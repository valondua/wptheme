# Screenshot Information

Since I cannot create an actual PNG file in this environment, you'll need to add a screenshot.png file manually.

## Requirements for screenshot.png:
- **Dimensions**: 1200px × 900px
- **Format**: PNG
- **Content**: A preview of your theme design
- **Location**: Place it in the root of your theme folder

## Quick way to create one:
1. Take a screenshot of your theme in action on your site
2. Resize it to 1200×900 pixels
3. Save as "screenshot.png"
4. Upload to your GitHub repository

This file helps WordPress show a preview of your theme in the admin area.
